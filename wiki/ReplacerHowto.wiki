= Samples =
== Sample1 ==
You want to display comments on posts from a blog.
Look in the page and find the node containing both post and comments.
On blogspot you could find, a div[@class='post-outer']
so config will be 

 * Comments blogspot.com
 * http://[^\\.]+\\.blogspot\\.com
 * xpath://div[@class='post-outer']
 * $1

== Sample2 ==
You want to display image of comic strip instead current link.
Url of the site is "feedproxied", so we can use regular expression power to add multiple possibilities.
in the replaed item, $0 is the whole found expression
$1 is the first group inside whole result (a group is defined by parenthesis.)

 * Gocomics pictures
 * http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uclick/| http://www.gocomics.com/
 * "(http://imgsrv.gocomics.com/dim/[^"]*)"
 * <img src='$1'><br/>
